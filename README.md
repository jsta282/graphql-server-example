# GraphQL tutorial
This is the code for my Medium blog post on spinning up a GraphQL server that supports queries and mutations.


Before you install the project locally ensure you have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your machine.

## Setting this up locally
- Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/andela-rbabalola/dms-graphql.git
```

- Move into to the project's directory
```
cd dms-graphql
```
- Install dependencies
```
npm install
```

- Start the app
```
npm start
```
If all went well you should see this message
```
GraphQL Server listening on PORT 3000
```

- Navigate to `localhost:3000/graphql` on your broswer and you should see the graphiql interface
